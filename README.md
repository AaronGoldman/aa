Cliff Click Language Hacking
============================

**Too-the-metal performance:** every abstraction used can be peeled away,
yielding code that you would expect from a tightly written low-level program.
This is a primary driver for me, the guy who's been writing compilers for high
performance computing (including Java) all my life.

**Modern:** Statically typed.  Functional programming with full H-M strength type
inference.  Minimal syntax.  REPL (i.e. incremental static typing) and seperate
compilation.  Typed C-style macros: most syntax errors in dead code are typed.

My intent is a modern language that can be used where C or C++ is used: low-level
high-performance work and a systems implementation language (e.g. OS's, device
drivers, GC's), but bring in all the goodness of the last 20 years of language
improvements.

I specifically intend to look at real-time constraints and the notion of Time
in a language.

Part of modern coding is the use Garbage Collection and the structured use of
malloc/free - so I intend to add Rust-style memory management.

Part of modern coding is the use of multiple cores, so I intend to explore a
couple of different concurrency models.

And of course, this is a Work-In-Progress!!!!

`a=@{x=1,x=2}`    | `Cannot define field '.x' twice`
`a=@{x=1.2,y,}; a.x` | `1.2:flt` Standard "." field name lookups; trailing comma optional
`(a=@{x,y}; a.)`  | `Missing field name after '.'`
`a=@{x,y}; a.x=1` | `Cannot re-assign field '.x'` No reassignment yet
`a=@{x=0,y=1}; b=@{x=2}; c=math_rand(1)?a:b; c.x` | `:int8` Either 0 or 2; structs can be partially merged and used
`a=@{x=0,y=1}; b=@{x=2}; c=math_rand(1)?a:b; c.y` | `Unknown field '.y'` Used fields must be fully available
`dist={p->p.x*p.x+p.y*p.y}; dist(@{x=1})` | `Unknown field '.y'`  Field not available inside of function

`dist={p->p//qqq`<br>`.//qqq`<br>`x*p.x+p.y*p.y}; dist(//qqq`<br>`@{x//qqq`<br>`=1,y=2})` | `5:int`  Some rather horrible comments
Named type variables | Named types are simple subtypes
`gal=:flt`        | `gal{flt -> gal:flt}` Returns a simple type constructor function
`gal=:flt; {gal}` | `gal{flt -> gal:flt}` Operator syntax for the function
`gal=:flt; 3==gal(2)+1` | `1:int` Auto-cast-away `gal` to get a `flt`
`gal=:flt; tank:gal = gal(2)` | `2:gal` 
`gal=:flt; tank:gal = gal(2)+1` | `3.0 is not a gal:flt` No-auto-cast into a `gal`
`Point=:@{x,y}; dist={p:Point -> p.x*p.x+p.y*p.y}; dist(Point(@{x=1,y=2}))` | `5:int` type variables can be used anywhere a type can, including function arguments
`Point=:@{x,y}; dist={p       -> p.x*p.x+p.y*p.y}; dist(Point(@{x=1,y=2}))` | `5:int` this `dist` takes any argument with fields `@{x,y}`, `Point` included
`Point=:@{x,y}; dist={p:Point -> p.x*p.x+p.y*p.y}; dist(     (@{x=1,y=2}))` | `@{x:1,y:2} is not a Point:@{x,y}` this `dist` only takes a `Point` argument
Nullable and not-null modeled after Kotlin | ---
`x:str? = 0`      | `null`  question-type allows null or not; zero digit is null
`x:str? = "abc"`  | `"abc":str` question-type allows null or not
`x:str  = 0`      | `"null is not a str"`
`math_rand(1)?0:"abc"` | `"abc"?` Null-or-string "abc"
`(math_rand(1)?0 : @{x=1}).x` | `Struct might be null when reading field '.x'` Must be provable not-null
`p=math_rand(1)?0:@{x=1}; p ? p.x : 0` | `:int1` not-null-ness after a null-check, so field de-ref is OK
`x:int = y:str? = z:flt = 0` | `0:int` null/0 freely recasts
`"abc"==0`        | `0:int` Compare vs null
`"abc"!=0`        | `1:int` Compare vs null
`nil=0; "abc"!=nil` | `1:int` Another name for 0/null
`a = math_rand(1) ? 0 : @{x=1}; b = math_rand(1) ? 0 : @{c=a}; b ? (b.c ? b.c.x : 0) : 0` | `int1` Nested nullable structs


Done Stuff
----------

* Static typing; types optional & fully inferred at every place.
* Null-ptr distinguished; null/notnull types (e.g. Kotlin)
* Duck-typing.  Interfaces.
* Functional; 1st class functions.
* REPL
* Dynamic code-gen; no seperate compilation step.  Load Source & Go.
* Limited overloads.
* Overloading ops.  No ambiguity / easy-to-read rules.
* By default multi-arg ops are overloaded.
* Direct SSA style code writing; no 'let' keyword.
* default "x=1" makes a "val" until scope runs out (cannot re-assign)
* Primitive values; int overflow OK;
* Sub-byte ranges.  Julia-like math typing.
* Can type-name primitives, but no e.g. physical-unit-type math


Ideas, Desirables
-----------------

* H-M style typing.
* JIT'ing.
* {GC,Ref-Counting}: Ponder both vs requiring e.g. lifetime management (easy by just raising scope).
* No exceptions?!!?  Same as Elm: allow tagged union returns with an error return
  vs a non-error return.  Force user to handle errors up&down the stack.
* Lexical scope destructors.
* Can ask for Int for BigInteger; unboxed arrays.
* Pattern-matching too handy looking, need to have it
* Parallel (and distributed) but also deterministic
* "eval"
* Monads?  i/o, side-effect monads.

lifetime:

* Distributed ref-cnting?  (or Dist-GC?)
* Ref-Counting does NOT given "immediate" destructor execution, but "soon".
* Guaranteed to count down & release before the next instance of exact same constructor constructs?
* Guaranteed to count down & release before the next loop backedge?  Before base of containing loop?
* Built-in "pools" for bulk-remove?  Same as ref-counting.
* Rust-style memory lifetime management; linear logic owner; borrowing; guaranteed death

concurrency:

* Pony-style concurrency management
* CAS built-in lang primitive: 'res := atomic(old,new)'; JMM
* CPS for threads/concurrency;
* not really actors but spawn/fork worker threads, run until they 'join' with parent.
* Transactions-for-shared-memory-always (Closure style)

types and name spaces and nulls:

* OOP namespaces (distinguished "this"; classes; single-inheritance vs interfaces)
* Modules: independent shipping of code.
* Elm-style union types
* Single inheritance (or none; composition also works).
* physical-unit-types, esp for arrays; e.g. "fueltank_size:gallon", and "speed:mile/hour", with auto-conversions

performance types:

* performance types: "no autoboxing, no big-int, no dynamic dispatch, no serial loops?"
* also: No GC allocations (only ref-counting & rust-style lifetime management).
* Runs in "O(1) time"?  Runs in "O(N) time"?
* associated affine-value types: "this int is equal to that int, plus or minus a constant".

>     `fun copyInt2Dbl( src:[]int32, dst:[src.len+0]d64 )...`
> 
> OR
> 
>     `fun copyInt2Dbl( len:int32, src:[len]int32, dst:[len]d64 )...`
> 
> OR
> 
>     `fun slide( len:int32, off:int32, src:[>=len]a, dst[>=len+off]a )...`

maps & parallel loops:

* maps-over-collections; default to parallel
* parallel/distributed collections; deterministic
* maps-with-folds require a associative fold op (and will run log-tree style)
* maps-without-assoc-folds are serial loops: code it as a loop
* user-spec'd iter types; for-loop syntax-sugar

serial loops:

* For-loops with early-exit and Python else-clause

```python
for( foo in foos )
  if( isAcceptable(foo) )
    break;
  else return DidNotFindItError()
```
        
* To detect never-ran vs ran-but-not-exited:
          
```python
    if( foos.empty() ) return foos_was_empty
    else
      for( foo in foos )
        if( isAcceptable(foo) )
          break;
      else return no_acceptable_in_foos()
```

misc:

* embed 'fact' in string: "milage=%(dist/gals) mph".  The expression (dist/gals) is
a standard paren-wrapped 'fact' from the grammar.
* multi-value-returns OK, sugar over returning a temp-tuple
* Extra "," in static struct makers OK: `"{'hello','world',}"`
* Tail-recursion optimization.
* "var" can be reassigned but requires type keyword: "x:= 1"
